    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Machine Learning Classifer Analysis for Fetal State Assessment (February 2023)  <a href="https://github.com/alekhya03v/fetal-state-assessment-ml">Link</a></h4> 
            
            <ul>
                <li> Developed a classification model using Cardiotocography dataset (2,000+ records) to assess fetal well-being,
                    with KNN achieving the highest accuracy up to 98.7% among other models like ANN, SVM and Random forests</li>
                <li>Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning, evaluated results using K-fold cross-validation</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Stock Price Prediction using SVR (October 2022) <a href="https://github.com/alekhya03v/stock-price-prediction">Link</a></h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Leveraged yfinance library to fetch historical stock data (last 30 days) and newsapi-python library to retrieve
                    news articles related to companies, achieving a Mean Squared Error of 0.003 in stock price predictions
                    </li>
                <li>Built and evaluated a Support Vector Regression model with 85% accuracy, integrating features from aligned
                    stock and news datasets and incorporating sentiment analysis of news data to enhance prediction reliability</li>
            </ul>
        <li><h4>Cryptocurrency Development (November 2021) <a href="https://github.com/alekhya03v/dscoin-cryptocurrency">Link</a></h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed a DSCoin Cryptocurrency model by developing an authentic blockchain that records the transactions
                    between a buyer, seller, and miner; implemented various methods using Linked Lists, Queues, and Merkle Trees</li>
                <li>Developed validation methods to handle invalid transactions from malicious miners, ensuring a robust service</li>
            </ul>
        <li><h4>Restaurants Nearby (October 2021) <a href="https://github.com/alekhya03v/restaurants-nearby">Link</a></h4></li>
